# London-Bike-Shares

Majority of Londoners are accustomed to cycling as a mode of transportation. While most people use their own bikes, others use a bike sharing app developed by the government. This repo investigates bike shares on this app from 2015 to 2017 and also build a machine learning model to predict bike shares.


The data can be found on Kaggle as london bike sharing dataset.
